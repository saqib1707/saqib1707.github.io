---

My name is Saqib and Iâ€™m a senior undergraduate pursuing Electrical Engineering, alongside a minor in Computer Science & Engineering, at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in/)<br>
To get a better insight on my life, you can have a look at my [curriculum vitae](({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/cv411.pdf)), research or my [Github profile](https://github.com/saqib1707). Feel free to read a bit more [about me]()<br>
<!-- Karl Broman is Professor in the
[Department of Biostatistics &amp; Medical Informatics](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu)
at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison;
research in statistical genetics; developer of
[R/qtl](https://rqtl.org) (for [R](https://www.r-project.org)). -->

Karl received a BS in [mathematics](http://uwm.edu/math)
in 1991, from the
University of Wisconsin&ndash;Milwaukee, and a
PhD in [statistics](http://stat.berkeley.edu) in 1997, from the
University of California, Berkeley; his PhD advisor was
[Terry Speed](http://www.wehi.edu.au/people/terry-speed).
He was a postdoctoral fellow with James Weber at the
[Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation](http://research.marshfieldclinic.org),
1997&ndash;1999. He
was a faculty member in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at Johns
Hopkins University, 1999&ndash;2007. In 2007, he moved to the
[University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](https://www.wisc.edu).

Karl is a Senior Editor for [_Genetics_](http://www.genetics.org),
Academic Editor for [_PeerJ_](https://peerj.com), and
a member of the [_BMC Biology_](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com)
[Editorial Board](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board).

Karl is an applied statistician focusing on problems in genetics and
genomics &ndash; particularly the analysis of meiotic recombination and the
genetic dissection of complex traits in experimental organisms. The
latter is often called &ldquo;QTL mapping.&rdquo; A QTL is a
_quantitative trait locus_ &ndash; a genetic locus that influences a
quantitative trait. Recently he has been focusing on the development
of interactive data visualizations for high-dimensional genetic data;
see his [R/qtlcharts package](http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts) and
his [D3 examples](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3).
