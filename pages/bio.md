---

My name is Saqib Azim, a senior undergraduate student (fourth year) from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in/) majoring in Electrical Engineering and pursuing minor in Computer Science and Engineering. My interests span a breadth of fields including computer vision, statistical machine learning, image processing, robotics vision and control, computational imaging, etc. with an inclination towards mathematics. Specifically, I have worked on problems of zero shot learning for object recognition, 3D handwriting recognition using smartwatch, indoor localization, compressed sensing, driverless cars, aggregation of uncontrolled multiagent system of robots, etc. <br>

Presently, I am working with [Prof. Debraj Chakraborty](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/dc) at IIT Bombay on shepherding of multiagent system using single pursuer with optimal trajectory where the task of the pursuer is to drive the agents to a predefined fixed destination point. <!-- analyzing the behaviour of pursuer and multiagent systems for finding the optimal behaviour with respect to time and trajectory length in driving the agents to fixed destination. --> <br>

In the summer of 2018, I had the oppurtunity to work with [Dr. Shankar M Venkatesan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shankar-venkatesan-7a849258/) in Advanced Technology Lab at [Samsung Research Institute Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) on airwriting handwriting recognition using smartwatches. In 2017, I worked with [Prof. Subhasis Choudhary](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/main/main.html) in the Vision and Image Processing Lab at IIT Bombay on a beautiful and hot research topic of object recognition using Zero Shot Learning (ZSL) where we build models for recognizing unseen class objects (whose training examples the model has not seen during training).<br>

I also joined an on-campus student-driven team, [Innovation Cell](http://www.umiciitb.com/), working in Driverless Cars where I was responsible for handling the vision and machine learning aspects of the driverless car which involved detecting roads, side-lanes, obstacles etc, in different conditions of light (dark night, sunlight as well as partial shadow conditions).<br>
