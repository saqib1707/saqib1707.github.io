---

My name is Saqib Azim and I am currently a senior undergraduate student in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) at [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in/). I am interested in the statistical and mathematical aspects of signal and image processing, computer vision and machine learning. Apart from this, I am also interested in vision and control with respect to robotics.

Presently, I am working with [Prof. Debraj Chakraborty](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/dc) at IIT Bombay on 
shepherding of multiagent system using single pursuer where the task of the pursuer is to drive the agents to a fixed destination point in a time optimal or path-length optimal way. <!-- analyzing the behaviour of pursuer and multiagent systems for finding the optimal behaviour with respect to time and trajectory length in driving the agents to fixed destination. -->

In the summer of 2018, I had the oppurtunity to work with [Dr. Shankar M Venkatesan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shankar-venkatesan-7a849258/) in Advanced Technology Lab at [Samsung Research Institute Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) on airwriting handwriting recognition using smartwatches. In 2017, I worked with [Prof. Subhasis Choudhary](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/main/main.html) in the Vision and Image Processing Lab at IIT Bombay on a beautiful and hot research topic of object recognition using Zero Shot Learning (ZSL) where we build models for recognizing unseen class objects (whose training examples the model has not seen during training).

I also joined an on-campus student-driven team, [Innovation Cell](http://www.umiciitb.com/), working in Driverless Cars where I was responsible for handling the vision and machine learning aspects of the driverless car which involved detecting roads, side-lanes, obstacles etc, in different conditions of light (dark night, sunlight as well as partial shadow conditions).
