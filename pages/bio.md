---

My name is Saqib Azim and I am currently a senior undergraduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I am interested in the statistical and mathematical aspects of signal and image processing, computer vision and machine learning. Apart from this, I am also interested in the vision and control with respect to robotics.

Presently, I am working with Prof. Debraj Chakraborty at IIT Bombay on analyzing the behaviour of pursuer and multiagent systems with finding the optimal behaviour with respect to time and trajectory length in driving the agents to fixed destination.

In the summer of 2018, I had the oppurtunity to work with Dr. Shankar M Venkatesan in Advanced Technology Lab at Samsung Research Institute Bangalore on Airwriting handwriting recognition using smartwatches. In 2017, I worked with Prof. Subhasis Choudhary in the Vision and Image Processing Lab at IIT Bombay on the beautiful and hot research topic of Object Recognition using Zero Shot Learning (ZSL) where we build models for recognizing unseen class objects (whose training examples the model has not seen during training).

I also joined an on-campus student-driven team, Innovation Cell, working in Driverless Cars where I was responsible for handling the Vision and Machine Learning aspects of the driverless car which involved detecting roads, side-lanes etc, in different conditions of light (dark night, sunlight as well as partial shadow conditions).



<!-- Right since my freshmen year at IIT Bombay, apart from the regular classwork and assignments, I used to delve myself into computer algorithms and being an EE student gave me an extra motivation to get to know what other departments and specifically Computer Science has to offer. <br>
In my sophomore year summer, I worked under the guidance of Professor Subhasis Chaudhari from Electrical Department. The project involved recognizing objects using ​Zero Shot Learning​​. The work involved developing neural network models and training and testing on various benchmark datasets. I was able to achieve quite significant improvements in accuracy compared to already existing implementations for prediction of animal classes which were not trained or seen by the model.<br>
I also joined an on-campus student-driven team working in Driverless Cars where I was responsible for handling the Vision and Machine Learning aspects of the driverless car which involved detecting roads and side-lanes in different conditions of light (dark night, sunlight as well as partial shadow conditions). This gave me valuable insights into deploying vision algorithms in real life applications and the peculiarities involved in them. This was the first time when I realized the difference between making a system work in a demo situation versus actually implementing in real life scenario and delivering it on a large-scale.<br> -->
