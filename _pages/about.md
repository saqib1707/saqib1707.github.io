---

My name is Saqib Azim, and I am a researcher in the Intelligent Vision Research Department at [Hitachi Central Research Lab](https://www.hitachi.com/rd/), Tokyo. I am advised by [Dr. Katsuyuki Nakamura](https://jp.linkedin.com/in/katsuyuki-nakamura-19b9bb88) and Mr. Takumi Nito, working in the area of computer vision and deep learning. My research interests lies in the areas of machine learning and its inter-disciplinary applications, optimization, computer vision, robotics, signal and image processing.

I graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science from [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in) in 2019. I also received the Undergraduate Research Award 2019. During my undergraduate, I have worked on interesting research problems such as, Zero-Shot Learning for object recognition, Handwritten Text Recognition using Smartwatch, Indoor Positioning Systems, Compressed Sensing, Optimal Pursuer-Evader Shepherding Problem, etc.

I was advised by [Prof. Debraj Chakraborty](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/dc) for my UG thesis on [Optimal Pursuer-Evader Shepherding Problem]({{site.url}}/assets/pubs/btp_thesis.pdf). In Summer 2018, I collaborated with [Dr. Shankar Venkatesan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shankar-venkatesan-7a849258/) at [Samsung Research Institute](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) on Handwritten Text Recognition using Smartwatch IMU sensors. In my junior year, I worked under the guidance of [Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/main/main.html) in the [VIP Lab](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viplab/), IIT Bombay on Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) for Object Recognition.

I have also been a part of a student-driven **Autonomous Driving Car** team at [Innovation Cell](http://www.umiciitb.com/), IIT Bombay, where I worked on vision and machine learning aspects of the driverless car involving detection of roads, side-lanes, obstacles, etc. under varying lighting conditions.
